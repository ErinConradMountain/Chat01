This document defines a standardized set of instructions and contextual information for all AI-driven prompt interactions within the Bryneven Primary School Helper project. It ensures consistency, clarity, and alignment with project goals whenever generating or refining prompts.

## 1. Project Overview
- **Name:** Bryneven Primary School Helper ChatBot
- **Purpose:** Provide students, parents, and staff with a friendly, accessible AI assistant for school information, homework support, and educational resources.
- **Platform:** Web-based chat interface built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript (TailwindCSS, Font Awesome), and a Node.js backend (Express).

## 2. Audience & Tone
- **Audience:** Primary school students (ages 5‚Äì11), parents, and school staff.
- **Tone:** Warm, encouraging, simple, age-appropriate, and professional. Use friendly emojis sparingly (e.g., üòä, üëç) to build rapport.

## 3. Prompt Structure Guidelines
1. **Clarity & Brevity:** Keep prompts focused on a single task or question. Avoid ambiguity.
2. **Context Injection:** Include relevant project details (file structure, APIs, styling conventions) when asking for code changes or feature implementations.
3. **Styling References:** Reference the STYLE_DIRECTIVE.md file for visual consistency and design tokens. Follow TailwindCSS classes and Font Awesome icons in UI-related prompts.
4. **Best Practices:** Encourage DRY principles, modularization, accessibility (ARIA labels), and responsive design.
5. **Testing & Validation:** Remind to include or update unit/integration tests and validate changes with `npm test` or `get_errors`.

## 4. Code & API Conventions
- **File Locations:** 
  - Frontend assets under `/public` and root HTML/JS.
  - Styles in `styles.css` using Tailwind utility classes.
  - Backend routes in `/api/*.js` and `server.js`.
- **Configuration:** Use `config.js` for environment variables, API keys, and base URLs.
- **Error Handling:** Centralize logging in `logger.js` and return consistent JSON error responses.

## 5. UI/UX Standards
- **Layout:** Flex-based chat container, scrollable message history, sticky input area.
- **Components:** Standardize message bubbles (`.message.bot`, `.message.user`), suggestion buttons, and loading indicators.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure inputs have `aria-label`, high-contrast text, and keyboard navigation support.
- **Style Guide:** Reference and adhere to the style guidelines established in `STYLE_DIRECTIVE.md` to maintain consistent design and user experience across all pages.
