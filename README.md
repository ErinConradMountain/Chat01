## Weekly Curation & Iteration

To keep the chatbot's knowledge base fresh and accurate, perform a weekly review of flagged logs and update as needed.

### How to Run Curation

1. Ensure flagged logs are saved in `flagged_logs.txt` (update `logger.js` if needed).
2. Run the curation script:
   ```bash
   node curate.js
   ```
   - The script will guide you through reviewing flagged logs, updating knowledge files, and suggesting prompt tweaks.
   - Optionally, collect your best Qâ†’A pairs for future fine-tuning.

### Reminder
- Set a recurring calendar reminder (e.g., every Monday) for a curation session.
- At least one team member should be available for this review each week.
