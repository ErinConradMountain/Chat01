    "summary": "A comprehensive outline of the system’s modular architecture, its API integration layer, and a viability assessment for adopting various technologies.",
    "report": "1. Introduction: Overview of ChatBot Version 1’s modular, layered design and its extension points for external APIs.\n\n2. Architecture Layers:\n   a. Presentation Layer (docs/): Static assets (HTML/CSS/JS) driving the UI, loaded directly in the browser.\n   b. Integration Layer (api/): Express routes (chat.js, qwen-evaluate.js) that mediate between UI and services. Acts as a pluggable hub for third‑party APIs.\n   c. Data Layer (data/, docs/data/): JSON/JS modules providing knowledge, quizzes, and homework content. Readable both server‑side and client‑side.\n   d. Core Services (server.js, config.js, logger.js): Central server setup, configuration management, logging, and environment configuration.\n\n3. Modulation Aspect:\n   • Each service endpoint in api/ is designed as a self‑contained module with clear input/output contracts.\n   • Config.js holds endpoint definitions and credentials, enabling feature toggles and dynamic routing.\n   • Logger.js wraps integrations with standardized tracing for monitoring and debugging.\n\n4. API Integration Points & Viability:\n   • Chat Processing: api/chat.js can plug in models via REST (OpenAI, Azure, Qwen) or WebSockets. Viability: Node‑friendly SDKs exist; fallback to HTTP fetch.\n   • Evaluation Service: api/qwen-evaluate.js demonstrates custom evaluation using Qwen model. Extensible to other LLMs by swapping client libraries and adjusting payload format.\n   • External Data: Data Layer can be replaced or augmented by database connectors (MongoDB, PostgreSQL), caching layers (Redis) or headless CMS (Strapi). Viability: Express middleware pattern and promise‑based I/O.\n\n5. Technology Assessment Table:\n| Integration | Pattern | Library/SDK | Complexity | Recommendation |\n|-------------|---------|-------------|------------|----------------|\n| OpenAI LLM  | REST    | openai npm  | Low        | Suitable for chat and summarization. |\n| Azure LLM   | REST    | @azure/ai   | Medium     | Good enterprise support and compliance. |\n| Database    | CRUD    | mongoose/pg | Medium     | Enables dynamic content, adds complexity. |\n| Redis Cache | Cache   | ioredis     | Medium     | Improves performance for high‑traffic. |\n| Strapi CMS  | REST    | N/A         | High       | Full CMS capabilities, steeper setup. |\n\n6. Extension Guidelines:\n   • To add a new integration, create a module in api/ following existing examples.\n   • Add credentials and endpoints in config.js under an `integrations` key.\n   • Wrap calls in logger instrumentation and error handling.\n   • Write unit tests or integration tests under a new test folder.\n\n7. Conclusion: The program’s modular architecture and clear separation of concerns make it highly viable for integration with modern APIs and services. By following the outlined patterns, teams can quickly evaluate and incorporate new technologies into ChatBot Version 1."
