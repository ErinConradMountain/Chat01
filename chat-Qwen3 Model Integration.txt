### ASSISTANT
To use the **Qwen3-30B-A3B (free)** model in your app, you can follow these steps. Since this model is available via **Hugging Face**, **Replicate**, or other AI platform APIs (based on how it's hosted), we’ll cover integration using an API-based approach — which is the easiest and most scalable way to integrate large language models into apps.

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

1. **Account on the hosting platform** (e.g., Hugging Face, Replicate, etc.)
2. **API key** for accessing the model.
3. Your app built with a backend framework (Node.js, Python Flask/Django, etc.) or frontend (React Native, Swift, etc.), depending on your architecture.
4. Basic knowledge of making HTTP requests (e.g., `fetch`, `axios`, `requests`).

---

## 🧩 Step-by-Step Guide to Use Qwen3-30B-A3B in Your App

### 🔹 1. Get Access to the Model

Check where the model is hosted:

#### Option A: [Hugging Face Inference API](https://huggingface.co/qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B)
- Go to the model page: [qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B](https://huggingface.co/qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B)
- Click **"Deploy"** or use their **Inference API**
- Create a token from your Hugging Face account settings.

#### Option B: [Replicate](https://replicate.com/)
- Search for `qwen3-30b-a3b`
- Get the model API URL and token.

We'll assume **Hugging Face** for this guide.

---

### 🔹 2. Make an API Request to the Model

Here’s how to call the model using Python:

```python
import requests

API_URL = "https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B"
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN"}

def query_model(prompt):
    payload = {
        "inputs": prompt,
        "parameters": {
            "max_new_tokens": 512,
            "temperature": 0.7,
            "top_p": 0.9,
            "do_sample": True
        }
    }
    response = requests.post(API_URL, headers=headers, json=payload)
    return response.json()

# Example usage
response = query_model("Explain the theory of relativity in simple terms.")
print(response)
```

> Replace `YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN` with your actual token.

---

### 🔹 3. Integrate Into Your App

Depending on your app type:

#### 🟢 Web App (Backend - Python Flask Example)

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import requests

app = Flask(__name__)

HF_API_URL = "https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B"
HF_TOKEN = "YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN"

@app.route("/ask", methods=["POST"])
def ask():
    data = request.json
    user_prompt = data.get("prompt")

    payload = {
        "inputs": user_prompt,
        "parameters": {
            "max_new_tokens": 512,
            "temperature": 0.7,
            "top_p": 0.9,
            "do_sample": True
        }
    }

    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {HF_TOKEN}"}
    response = requests.post(HF_API_URL, headers=headers, json=payload)
    result = response.json()

    return jsonify({"response": result})

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Then, in your frontend (React, Vue, etc.), send POST requests to `/ask`.

---

### 🔹 4. Frontend Integration (Optional)

Example using JavaScript (`fetch`) in React:

```javascript
async function getAIResponse(prompt) {
  const res = await fetch("http://localhost:5000/ask", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({ prompt })
  });
  const data = await res.json();
  console.log(data.response);
}
```

---

### 🔹 5. Optimize & Scale

- Use **caching** for repeated prompts.
- Implement **rate limiting** to avoid hitting API limits.
- Monitor usage and cost if switching to a paid plan later.
- Consider **local deployment** (see below) if you want full control and offline access.

---

## 🚀 Optional: Run Locally (Advanced)

If you have the necessary hardware (GPU), you can run the model locally using **Transformers**, **vLLM**, or **Ollama**:

### Using Transformers (Hugging Face)

```bash
pip install transformers accelerate
```

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B").to("cuda")

inputs = tokenizer("Tell me a joke.", return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=50)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

> Requires compatible GPU and enough VRAM (~40+ GB recommended).

### USER
I have the api key from Open Router. Provide instructions to my developer on how to set up the api to use it in the application. Here’s a summary you can give to the developer to help them understand the application and its API compatibility:

---

**What is this application?**  
This is a web-based educational chatbot platform for Bryneven Primary School. It features a chat interface, quizzes, homework help, art curation, and investigations. The frontend is built with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS (in public), and the backend is a Node.js/Express server (`server.js`).

**How does it use APIs?**  
- The main API endpoint is chat.js, which handles chat requests from the frontend.
- The frontend sends POST requests to `/api/chat` with user prompts and displays the responses.
- Static data (quizzes, knowledge, etc.) is loaded from JSON/JS files in data and data.

**Is it compatible with a new API?**  
Yes. If the new API can accept a prompt and return a text response (like Gemini or OpenAI), you can update chat.js to call the new API. The rest of the app will work as designed.

**Where to look for API integration:**  
- Main chat logic: chat.js
- Server entry: server.js
- Frontend chat: chat.js, index.html

**Documentation:**  
See DOCUMENTATION.md for project structure, API/data file locations, and architecture.

---

## Architecture Overview

ChatBot Version 1 follows a modular, layered architecture that separates concerns between the frontend, backend, and data sources:

### 1. Frontend (Client Side)
- Located in the `public/` directory.
- Built with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for the user interface.
- Handles user interactions, displays chat, quizzes, and knowledge sections.
- Fetches data and communicates with the backend via HTTP requests (e.g., chat API).
- Loads static data (like quiz questions) directly from files in `public/data/`.

### 2. Backend (Server Side)
- Main entry point: `server.js`.
- API logic is organized in the `api/` directory (e.g., `api/chat.js`).
- Handles chat requests, processes user input, and retrieves relevant knowledge or responses.
- Can serve static files and act as a bridge between frontend and data sources.
- Uses configuration and logging utilities (`config.js`, `logger.js`).

### 3. Data Sources
- Static JSON and JS files in `data/`, `public/data/`, and root directory (e.g., `art_knowledge.json`).
- Store knowledge bases, quiz questions, homework, and other content.
- Backend and frontend both access these files as needed (frontend uses only files in `public/`).

### 4. Deployment
- Designed for easy deployment (e.g., Vercel) with configuration in `vercel.json` and optional proxy logic in `vercel-proxy/`.

### 5. Interaction Flow
- Users interact with the UI in the browser.
- The frontend sends requests to backend APIs for chat and dynamic features.
- The backend processes requests, accesses data sources, and returns responses.
- Static content (quizzes, knowledge) is loaded directly by the frontend from public data files.

This architecture allows for clear separation of concerns, easy customization of data/content, and straightforward extension of features.

---

### ASSISTANT
Here's a **developer-ready guide** for integrating the **Qwen3-30B-A3B model via Open Router API** into your educational chatbot application.

---

# 🧠 Qwen3-30B-A3B Integration Guide (via Open Router)

## 🔧 Overview

This document provides clear instructions for developers to integrate the **Qwen3-30B-A3B** large language model using an **Open Router API key**, into the existing **educational chatbot platform** for Bryneven Primary School. The app is built with:

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express (`server.js`)
- **Chat Logic**: `api/chat.js`

The integration will allow the bot to respond intelligently to user prompts by calling the LLM through the Open Router API.

---

## 📦 Prerequisites

1. ✅ You have an **Open Router API key**.
2. ✅ Node.js and npm installed.
3. ✅ Access to `api/chat.js` and `server.js`.
4. ✅ Basic knowledge of HTTP requests and JSON handling in Node.js.

---

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Integration

### 1. 🔑 Store Your Open Router API Key Securely

In your project root directory, create or update a `.env` file:

```env
OPEN_ROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
```

> Make sure this file is **not committed** to version control (add it to `.gitignore`).

Install `dotenv` if not already present:

```bash
npm install dotenv
```

Then at the top of `server.js`, add:

```js
require('dotenv').config();
```

---

### 2. 📥 Update Dependencies

Ensure you have `axios` or `node-fetch` for making HTTP requests:

```bash
npm install axios
```

Or:

```bash
npm install node-fetch
```

---

### 3. 🧬 Modify `api/chat.js` to Use Open Router API

Replace the current chat logic with the following code:

#### ✅ Using Axios

```js
const axios = require("axios");

async function getLLMResponse(prompt) {
  try {
    const response = await axios.post(
      "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions",
      {
        model: "qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b:free", // Model identifier
        messages: [
          {
            role: "user",
            content: prompt,
          },
        ],
        max_tokens: 512,
        temperature: 0.7,
        top_p: 0.9,
      },
      {
        headers: {
          Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.OPEN_ROUTER_API_KEY}`,
          "Content-Type": "application/json",
        },
      }
    );

    return response.data.choices[0].message.content;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching from Open Router:", error.response?.data || error.message);
    return "I'm sorry, I couldn't process that request.";
  }
}

module.exports = { getLLMResponse };
```

---

### 4. 🔄 Update Server Route in `server.js`

Update your `/api/chat` route to use the new LLM handler:

```js
const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router();
const { getLLMResponse } = require("./api/chat");

router.post("/chat", async (req, res) => {
  const userPrompt = req.body.prompt;

  if (!userPrompt) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: "Missing prompt" });
  }

  const botReply = await getLLMResponse(userPrompt);

  res.json({ reply: botReply });
});

module.exports = router;
```

---

### 5. 🌐 Frontend Integration (Optional but Recommended)

In `public/chat.js`, ensure the frontend sends POST requests to `/api/chat` like this:

```js
async function sendMessage() {
  const input = document.getElementById("user-input");
  const message = input.value.trim();
  if (!message) return;

  appendMessage("You", message);
  input.value = "";

  const response = await fetch("/api/chat", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ prompt: message }),
  });

  const data = await response.json();
  appendMessage("Bot", data.reply);
}
```

---

## 📋 Summary of Changes

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `.env` | Add `OPEN_ROUTER_API_KEY` |
| `server.js` | Load environment variables |
| `api/chat.js` | Add logic to call Open Router with Qwen3-30B-A3B |
| `server.js` | Update `/api/chat` route to use new handler |
| `public/chat.js` | Ensure correct frontend interaction |

---

## 🧪 Testing Locally

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
2. Open `http://localhost:3000/index.html` (or your dev port).
3. Type a question in the chat UI and see if the bot responds using the LLM.

---

## ⚙️ Optional: Fine-tuning Parameters

You can adjust these in the API request body:

```js
{
  model: "qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b:free",
  messages: [...],
  max_tokens: 512,
  temperature: 0.7,
  top_p: 0.9,
}
```

- **`temperature`**: Lower for more deterministic responses, higher for creativity.
- **`max_tokens`**: Adjust depending on expected output length.

---

## 📦 Deployment Notes
